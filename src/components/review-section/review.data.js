        review: 'This was such a fun workshop in a really cool space. I can\'t really describe the calm feeling of mixing and pouring cement into a planter mould, or the serenity of arranging a succulent. Graham and Dun are exciting hosts and teachers, very knowledgeable and willing to work with you even on crazy ideas. Would recommend. Would do again. Would.',
